FIX ONLY THE PROFILE PICTURE - Keep Everything Else the Same

ISSUE: Profile picture is B&W and has weird hover effect
GOAL: Make profile picture always colored and well-positioned

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
UPDATE src/components/About.tsx
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

KEEP the current layout exactly as it is:
- Left side: Text content (01, subtitle, paragraphs, capability cards)
- Right side: Profile picture

ONLY FIX THE PROFILE PICTURE:

REMOVE:
❌ Black & white filter
❌ Hover effect that changes B&W to color
❌ Any grayscale/filter effects

NEW PROFILE PICTURE STYLING:
```tsx
<div className="relative">
  {/* Decorative background circle */}
  <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-br from-teal-500/20 to-cyan-500/20 rounded-full blur-3xl" />
  
  {/* Profile image */}
  <img
    src="/path-to-your-image.jpg"
    alt="Rahul Bandikolla"
    className="relative w-80 h-80 rounded-full object-cover
               border-2 border-teal-500/30
               shadow-2xl shadow-teal-500/20
               transition-transform duration-300
               hover:scale-105"
  />
</div>
```

KEY CHANGES:
1. ✓ Remove filter-grayscale and hover:filter-none
2. ✓ Image is always in FULL COLOR
3. ✓ Add subtle teal border (border-2 border-teal-500/30)
4. ✓ Add soft shadow with teal tint
5. ✓ Keep subtle hover scale effect (hover:scale-105)
6. ✓ Add decorative glow background (optional but nice)

STYLING DETAILS:
- Image size: w-80 h-80 (320x320px)
- Border radius: rounded-full (perfect circle)
- Border: 2px teal border with 30% opacity
- Shadow: Large shadow with teal tint for depth
- Hover: Slight scale up (1.05x) - subtle and professional
- Position: relative positioning for layering

DO NOT CHANGE:
- ✓ Section layout
- ✓ Text content
- ✓ Capability cards
- ✓ Section structure
- ✓ "01 About Me" heading
- ✓ Subtitle positioning
- ✓ Two-column layout

PROVIDE:
Only the updated About.tsx file with the profile picture fix.
Keep all other content exactly as it currently is.
